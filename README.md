# Welcome to the STEM Writing Project

![](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/stemwritingproject/blob/main/SWP_Logo.png)

We want to help STEM faculty make scientific writing a bigger part of their teaching toolbox. We have been putting together a collection of guidelines, training materials, class activites, student assessments, and deeper evaluation tools that make scientific writing instruction more evidence-based, systematic, and scalable. 

We have TWO homes on the web.

<br>

### Our Main Home is [BioQUEST/QUBES Hub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/stemwritingproject)

That's where you can learn about our __[Six Elements Model](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/stemwritingproject)__ for teaching scientific writing, download our training and teaching resources, and collaborate with us on non-coding projects. It's also the best place to see how the strands of our different projects come together.

### What Will You Find on GitHub?!

Here is where we store and share code and data files from research and development projects. These are some of the current repositories.

We have an [open-source Student Writing Guide for teaching scientific writing to undergraduates](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/SWP_student_writing_guide). The repo contains all the text and supporting files required to publish the Guide in print and digital formats. A second repo from the [ABLE 2022 Workshop](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/ABLE_2022_Workshop) details how to revise our guide for use at other institutions.

The [SAWHET v2.0](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/shinyapp.qubes) repo is an R Shiny application that collects and validates student lab reports. The code is released under a GNU GPL3 license for others to modify and extend. [A free public version of the application is available here.](https://yelr6j-dan-johnson.shinyapps.io/sawhet_v2_0/)

The [Biology Student Reports Archive](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/SWP_Student_Reports_Archive) contains >4400 anonymized student reports plus metadata, for research in text mining and computational linguistics.

The [GTA Comment Classifier](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/GTA_comment_classification) is a pilot project testing whether instructor comments on laboratory reports can be extracted and categorized on a mass scale.
