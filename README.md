# Welcome to the STEM Writing Project
Our goal is to help faculty make scientific writing a bigger part of their STEM teaching toolbox. We have assembled a collection of guidelines, training materials, class activites, and assessments that make scientific writing instruction more evidence-based, systematic, and scalable. 

The Project has several interconnected sub-projects; some have their own dedicated repositories. [The Project wiki](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/stemwritingproject/wiki) outlines the sub-projects and how the different strands come together.
