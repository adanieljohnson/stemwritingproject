# Welcome to the STEM Writing Project
We want to help STEM faculty make scientific writing a bigger part of their teaching toolbox. We have been putting together a collection of guidelines, training materials, class activites, student assessments, and deeper evaluation tools that make scientific writing instruction more evidence-based, systematic, and scalable. 

We have TWO homes on the web. Our main home is on the [BioQUEST/QUBES Hub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/stemwritingproject). That's where you can learn about our __Six Elements Model__ for teaching scientific writing, download our training and teaching resources, and collaborate with us on non-coding projects. It's also the best place to see how the strands of our different projects come together.


### What Are We Doing on GitHub?!

Here is where we store and share code and resources from our data analysis projects. We maintain several different repositories.

We have an [open-source Student Writing Guide for teaching scientific writing to undergraduates](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/SWP_student_writing_guide). The repo has all the text and supporting files required to publish it in print and digital formats. A separate repo from the [ABLE 2022 Workshop](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/ABLE_2022_Workshop) has detailed instructions for how to revise our guide for use at other institutions.

The [SAWHET v2.0](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/shinyapp.qubes) repo is an R Shiny application that collects and validates student lab reports. The code is released under a broad license for others to modify and extend.

The [Biology Student Reports Archive](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/SWP_Student_Reports_Archive) contains >4400 anonymized student reports plus metadata, for research in text mining and computational linguistics.

The [GTA Comment Classifier](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/GTA_comment_classification) is a pilot project testing whether instructor comments on laboratory reports can be extracted and categorized on a mass scale.
