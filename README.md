# Welcome to the STEM Writing Project
SWP's goal is to help faculty make scientific writing part of their STEM teaching toolbox. It is a collection of guidelines, training materials, class activites, and assessments that make scientific writing instruction more evidence-based, systematic, and scalable. 

SWP has several interconnected strands. Some sub-projects have their own dedicated repositories. [The Project wiki](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/stemwritingproject/wiki) outlines these strands and sub-projects and how they come together.
