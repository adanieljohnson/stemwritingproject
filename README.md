# Welcome to the STEM Writing Project
We want to help STEM faculty make scientific writing a bigger part of their teaching toolbox. We are putting together a collection of guidelines, training materials, class activites, student assessments, and deeper evaluation tools that make scientific writing instruction more evidence-based, systematic, and scalable. 

SWP has several interconnected sub-projects, some with their own dedicated repositories. **Go to the [the Project wiki](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/stemwritingproject/wiki)** to learn what we are doing, how the different strands come together, and find links to the relevant repoitories.
