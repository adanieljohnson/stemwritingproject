## Welcome to the STEM Writing Project!

We have two homes on the web. GitHub is where we store code and resources from our data analysis projects. Our other home is on the [BioQUEST/QUBES Hub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/stemwritingproject). That's where you can learn about our __Six Elements Model__ for teaching scientific writing, download our training and teaching resources, and collaborate with us on non-coding projects.

We maintain several different repositories here.

We have an [open-source Student Writing Guide for teaching scientific writing to undergraduates](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/SWP_student_writing_guide). The repo has all the text and supporting files to publish it in print and digital formats.A separate [ABLE 2022 Workshop](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/ABLE_2022_Workshop) repo has detailed instructions for how to revise our guide and use it at other institutions.

The [SAWHET v2.0](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/shinyapp.qubes) repo contains the code for an R Shiny application that collects and validates student reports. The code is released under a broad license for others to modify and extend.

The [Biology Student Reports Archive](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/SWP_Student_Reports_Archive) contains >4400 anonymized student reports plus metadata, for research in text mining and computational linguistics.

The [GTA Comment Classifier](https://github.com/adanieljohnson/GTA_comment_classification) is a pilot project testing whether instructor comments on laboratory reports can be extracted and categorized on a mass scale.
